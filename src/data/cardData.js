      'Long before the concept of the Foundation and the Community Chest, there were social service organizations that nursed the sick, raised funds, and organized resources to combat epidemics. These charitable organizations in New Orleans, each charged with raising their own charitable funds, were led by religious groups, ethnic groups, and non-sectarian orders.',
      'Following the devastation of the Civil War and the onset of the first World War, a group of prominent New Orleans civic leaders implemented a community organization called the Federation of Non-sectarian Charity and Philanthropy of New Orleans. This would be a true umbrella agency that would combine efforts at raising charitable funds to grant aid and assistance to needy groups.',

This would be a true umbrella agency that would combine efforts at raising charitable funds to grant aid and assistance to needy groups.',
      'Their main goals were to prevent indiscriminate and unauthorized solicitations, insure a fair and equitable distribution of funds in order to benefit the greatest number of citizens, insure a public detailed accounting of the allocation of funds by the Federation and by constituent organizations, and to allow constituent organizations to focus their efforts on managing their affairs without the necessity of soliciting funds.'

      'After the first World War there was tremendous necessity to raise funds to continue the social work programs developed during the War. The various war chests around the country demonstrated that successful fundraising could be done through one united campaign. The Committee on Philanthropy of the Association of the Association of Commerce of New Orleans gave its support to the idea of a Community Chest. All welfare agencies in the city of New Orleans were invited to go under the umbrella of the Community Chest. The Community Chest would establish standards to regulate the responsible management and recordkeeping of the agencies, and it would require all agencies to pledge that they would not solicit funds without the explicit approval of the Community Chest. The first organizational meeting of the Community Chest was held in the Science Building on the Tulane University Campus. Rabbi Emil W. Leipziger presided, Lloyd Adams recorded the minutes, and seven board members were elected.'

Erected on historic Lee Circle at 919 St. Charles Avenue, the building was designed by local architects Waggonner & Ball and constructed by F.H. Myers Construction Corp. in 18 months. The total cost of the 22,000 square foot building was $13 million that was entirely paid for with private donations during a multi-year capital campaign that was chaired by former Foundation board chairs Phyllis M.
