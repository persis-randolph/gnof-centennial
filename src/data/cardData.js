      'Long before the concept of the Foundation and the Community Chest, there were social service organizations that nursed the sick, raised funds, and organized resources to combat epidemics. These charitable organizations in New Orleans, each charged with raising their own charitable funds, were led by religious groups, ethnic groups, and non-sectarian orders.',
      'Following the devastation of the Civil War and the onset of the first World War, a group of prominent New Orleans civic leaders implemented a community organization called the Federation of Non-sectarian Charity and Philanthropy of New Orleans. This would be a true umbrella agency that would combine efforts at raising charitable funds to grant aid and assistance to needy groups.',

      'Their main goals were to prevent indiscriminate and unauthorized solicitations, insure a fair and equitable distribution of funds in order to benefit the greatest number of citizens, insure a public detailed accounting of the allocation of funds by the Federation and by constituent organizations, and to allow constituent organizations to focus their efforts on managing their affairs without the necessity of soliciting funds.'
